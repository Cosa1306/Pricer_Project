This Python code is an option pricer designed and developed by Thomas-Victor Coll and Sonny Genovese. It calculates the prices of European call and put options using the Black-Scholes model. Built with a user-friendly graphical interface, this tool allows users to input key option parameters such as the stock price, strike price, risk-free rate, time to maturity, and volatility.

In addition to pricing, the tool provides advanced functionality for calculating and displaying the Greeks—Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho—allowing a deep dive into how option prices respond to changes in various factors. Users can interact with the interface to visualize these sensitivities through dynamic plots, providing valuable insights into option behavior under different market conditions.

With intuitive parameter input fields, real-time results, and customizable Greek calculations, this pricer is ideal for finance students and professionals looking to explore and understand the complexities of option pricing.
